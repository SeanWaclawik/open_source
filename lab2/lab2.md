Read the four criteria for Free Software

Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
  It is important to choose a software license because without the license, your work is inheritly copy protected and can not 
  be used by others without them first contacting you for your explicite consent. By choosing a license you set forth the conditions
  by which others may use your software. In doing this it is understood how your work may be utilized and also gives users the way to 
  cite your work within their work.

Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license
  If a work does not have an explicit license the work is iherity copy right protected. Any use of the software, code, or ideas
  infringe on the creator's copyright and holds you liable for infrigement should you redistribute without explicite consent of 
  the creator. This would prove especially devistating to a company that should include un-licensed work as their entire product 
  could be deemed stolen work.

Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher

Do you agree with this claim? I agree with the claim the author of "the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher". There are two main reasons why. First, by allowing the userbase to control a greater part of the system, more user flocked to the web because it was more dynamic and inviting to outside work. Second, the web came from a more established background of the CERN than Gopher which came through the University of Minnesota. Although a reputable intitute, it was not of the same level.

Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses tge GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source.

Can you justify why such a license is chosen (Justification for ONE is enough).
  Microsoft .Net uses MIT license because  Microsoft wants to encourage opensource development for a cross-platform software. MS also   benefits from more users of the .Net by allowing it to be used, modified, and redistributed.
  
Think of an example project. Pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github.
  Rcos project "FunDo" <github.com/lusilva/fundo> using MIT license
  
Read these licenses GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good - write 5 to 10 sentences. You may use tldrlegal
  for a developer: LGPL would be better for the developer as it does not give the explicit right for those that use LGPL licensed        software to modify proprietary components. In addition, it allows for developers to link to proprietary software without having to      disclose it, allowing for maximum flexibility for the developer.
  for a company: BSD/Apache. This is because while modification and redistribution is allowed, the company using it does not have to        disclose the source code of their own to use. It can be included in their product without worry.
  for the common good: GPL is best for the common good as its strong "copy left" license leads to an all opensource world. Every new        modification and change is released back to the public, contributing to more opensource software.

Create a repository and choose a license
  I chose the MIT license for my open_source repository (where this project resides).

Take 5 projects from Observatory - create a table which project has which license. for example:
Website	License Present	License
https://github.com/rcos/Observatory	Yes	Two Clause BSD License https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license

| Project        | License      | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| github.com/AutoRoute/node      | MIT License | 
| github.com/wtg/shuttle_tracking_2      | NONE found  |
| github.com/makinj/MeNext | MIT License |
| github.com/RCOS-Grading-Server/HWserver | BSD License |
| github.com/makinj/MeNext | MIT License |

Write five sentences about choosing a project to work in this course and who will be users/customers and what license will you choose.

I want to work on a project this semester that will help users (and myself included) to better manage finance. 
The users/customers of my project will be those that find keeping ontop of a budget with credit cards difficult.
I will use the MIT license for our project. By using the MIT license, it allows for maximum freedom (as in liberty) for reuse, modification, and redistribution for all individuals, companies, governments, etc.
